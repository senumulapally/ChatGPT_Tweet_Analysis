The inspiration for this project comes from the widespread discussions and opinions about the new AI chatbot ChatGPT currently taking place over the internet. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that understands and generates natural human language with remarkable sophistication, sensitivity, and usability. ChatGPT has attracted more than 1 million users in just one week after it was launched, leaving behind other popular online platforms in terms of adoption rates. 

Early adopters are typically the most passionate and influential users of a product. Their opinions and sentiments can shape the overall perception of new technology. Therefore, exploring the early adopter sentiments, particularly for a disruptive technology such as ChatGPT, would increase the chances of success of the tool in the market. Analyzing the sentiment of tweets on ChatGPT, gives us a better understanding of how the people are responding to this new AI. It helps in gaining a deeper understanding of how the model is being used in the real-world and what kind of tasks people are using it for. We can also understand how the impact or usage of chatGPT is changing overtime. 

For this study, we have chosen to utilize Twitter as a source of data to assess the sentiments of early adopters of ChatGPT. 

The goal of this project is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to analyze the sentiment and the topics discussed in tweets containing the #ChatGPT. The project will involve collecting a large dataset of tweets, preprocessing the data, identifying teh topics and then training and evaluating the NLP model. The model will be trained to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Once the model is trained, it will be used to classify new tweets in real-time. The project will also include a visualization component, where the sentiment analysis results will be displayed on a dashboard. This will allow users to see the sentiment of ChatGPT tweets over time and filter the tweets by keywords and hashtags. The ultimate aim of this project is to understand how people are reacting to the language model and how the model is being used in the real-world.
